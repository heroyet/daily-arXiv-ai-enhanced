Using the Rabbit-Duck illusion, we illustrate how\nperspective-dependent readings of agent behavior can create epistemic\ninstability. To address this, we introduce the Misalignment Mosaic, a\ndiagnostic framework for diagnosing meaning-level misalignment in MAS. It\ncomprises four components: 1. Terminological Inconsistency, 2. Concept-to-Code\nDecay, 3. Morality as Cooperation, and 4. Interpretive Ambiguity. The Mosaic\nenables researchers to examine how misalignment arises not only through policy\nor reward structures but also through language, framing, and design\nassumptions. While this paper focuses on the specific ambiguity between\ncoordination and cooperation, the Mosaic generalizes to other overloaded\nconcepts in MAS, such as alignment, autonomy, and trust.

NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including\nself-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and\nspontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and\nmorphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This\nlimitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow\nquadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information\nwhich impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands\nof real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this\nlimitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by\nrecent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on\na coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary\nresolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and\ntexture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with\nminimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture\nand loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and\nperformance.

Students either report their true preferences, producing exogenous\nuncertainty, or act strategically, submitting reported preferences based on\ntheir true preferences and admission chances (which depend on capacities),\nintroducing endogenous uncertainty. In the second stage, the clearinghouse\ncomputes the student-optimal stable matching based on schools' priorities and\nstudents' reported preferences. In strategic cases, endogenous reported\npreferences are utility-maximizing transformations of capacity decisions and\nexogenous true preferences; we handle uncertainty using sample average\napproximation(SAA). We develop behavior-based mathematical formulations and,\ndue to problem complexity, propose Lagrangian- and local-search-based\nbehavior-specific heuristics for near-optimal solutions. Our SAA-based\napproaches outperform the average scenario approach on students' matching\npreferences and admission outcomes, emphasizing the impact of stochastic\npreferences on capacity decisions.

To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths\nand temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle\ndifferent temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal\nlengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically\nformulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may\nincur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size\nrenewal mechanism to alleviate this issue.

Iterative sound-matching automates this workflow by\ncontinually programming a synthesizer under the guidance of a loss function (or\nsimilarity measure) toward a target sound. Prior comparisons of loss functions\nhave typically favored one metric over another, but only within narrow\nsettings: limited synthesis methods, few loss types, often without blind\nlistening tests. This leaves open the question of whether a universally optimal\nloss exists, or the choice of loss remains a creative decision conditioned on\nthe synthesis method and the sound designer's preference. We propose\ndifferentiable iterative sound-matching as the natural extension of the\navailable literature, since it combines the manual approach to sound design\nwith modern advances in machine learning. To analyze the variability of loss\nfunction performance across synthesizers, we implemented a mix of four novel\nand established differentiable loss functions, and paired them with\ndifferentiable subtractive, additive, and AM synthesizers. For each of the\nsixteen synthesizer--loss combinations, we ran 300 randomized sound-matching\ntrials. Performance was measured using parameter differences,\nspectrogram-distance metrics, and manually assigned listening scores. We\nobserved a moderate level of consistency among the three performance measures.\nOur post-hoc analysis shows that the loss function performance is highly\ndependent on the synthesizer.

However,\ntraditional feature detectors such as SIFT and SURF, which rely on\nGaussian-based scale spaces, tend to suppress high-frequency edges, making them\nunsuitable for thin crack localization. Lightweight binary alternatives like\nORB and BRISK, while computationally efficient, often suffer from poor keypoint\nrepeatability on textured or shadowed surfaces. This study presents a\nphysics-informed alignment framework that adapts the open KAZE architecture to\nSHM-specific challenges. By utilizing nonlinear anisotropic diffusion to\nconstruct a crack-preserving scale space, and integrating RANSAC-based\nhomography estimation, the framework enables accurate geometric correction\nwithout the need for training, parameter tuning, or prior calibration. The\nmethod is validated on time-lapse images of masonry and concrete acquired via\nhandheld smartphone under varied field conditions, including shadow\ninterference, cropping, oblique viewing angles, and surface clutter.

Existing learning-based approaches often rely on\ndiscretization of outcome spaces to ensure truthfulness, which leads to\ninefficiency with increasing problem size. To address this limitation, we\nformalize the concept of pricing rules, defined as functions that map outcomes\nto prices. Based on this concept, we propose a novel menu mechanism, which can\nbe equivalent to a truthful direct mechanism under specific conditions. The\ncore idea of TEDI lies in its parameterization of pricing rules using Partial\nGroupMax Network, a new network architecture designed to universally\napproximate partial convex functions. To learn optimal pricing rules, we\ndevelop novel training techniques, including covariance trick and continuous\nsampling, to derive unbiased gradient estimators compatible with first-order\noptimization. Theoretical analysis establishes that TEDI guarantees\ntruthfulness, full expressiveness, and dimension-insensitivity. Experimental\nevaluation in the studied auction setting demonstrates that TEDI achieves\nstrong performance, competitive with or exceeding state-of-the-art methods.\n  This work presents the first approaches to learn truthful mechanisms without\noutcome discretization, thereby enhancing algorithmic efficiency.

A common limitation in\nexisting vision-based automatic pest counting research is that models are\ntypically evaluated on datasets with ground truth but deployed in real-world\nscenarios without assessing the reliability of counting results due to the lack\nof ground truth. To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively\nevaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related\nto counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest\ndetection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting\nresult-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality\nassessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity\nassessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image\nacquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude.\nNotably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis\nmethod to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity\nassessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for\npest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information\nrelated to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into\na regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting\nconfidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to\ncomprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and\nquantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting\nconfidence through a model. Experimental results show our method reduces MSE by\n31.7% and improves R2 by 15.2% on the pest counting confidence test set,\ncompared to the baseline built primarily on information related to counting\nresults.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u6570\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bb3\u866b\u8ba1\u6570\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u52a8\u5bb3\u866b\u8ba1\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8ba1\u6570\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u65e0\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5bb3\u866b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u5bb3\u866b\u5206\u5e03\u5747\u5300\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u8ba1\u6570\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bb3\u866b\u8ba1\u6570\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMSE\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8631.7%\uff0cR2\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8615.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u8ba1\u6570\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u4e0e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cbe\u51c6\u519c\u4e1a\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Existing approaches for multi-robot\nrelative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like\ncameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high\ncomputational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint\nenvironments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel\ndistributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull\nof multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ\nco-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal\nStrength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware\nmulti-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based\nalignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI\nfield of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are\nutilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative\nlocalization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations\nwith that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with\nlimited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi\nRSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or\noffline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed\nMGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments,\ncomparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches.

Understanding the interactions across these scales is\nessential for fully comprehending such complex problems. However, visualizing\nmultivariate, multiscale data within an integrated view where correlations\nacross space, scales, and fields are easily perceived remains challenging. To\naddress this, we introduce a novel local spatial statistical visualization of\nflow fields across multiple fields and turbulence scales. Our method leverages\nthe curvelet transform for scale decomposition of fields of interest, a\nlevel-set-restricted centroidal Voronoi tessellation to partition the spatial\ndomain into local regions for statistical aggregation, and a set of glyph\ndesigns that combines information across scales and fields into a single, or\nreduced set of perceivable visual representations. Each glyph represents data\naggregated within a Voronoi region and is positioned at the Voronoi site for\ndirect visualization in a 3D view centered around flow features of interest.

This is an initial version for\n  discussion purposes", "summary": "This position paper aims to rethink the role and design of memory in Large\nLanguage Model (LLM)-based agent systems. We observe that while current memory\npractices have begun to transcend the limitations of single interactions, they\nremain conceptually grounded in \"bound memory\" in terms of design concept-where\nmemory is treated as local state attached to specific context or entities,\nforming \"memory silos\" that impede cross-entity collaboration. To overcome this\narchitectural bottleneck, this paper proposes the timely design perspective of\n\"Memory as a Service\" (MaaS). MaaS advocates decoupling memory from its\nconventional role as an interaction byproduct and encapsulating it as a modular\nservice that can be independently callable, dynamically composable, and finely\ngoverned. At its core, MaaS leverages the duality of memory-its inherently\nprivate nature and its potential for public service-to grant memory controlled,\non-demand interoperability across entities. This paper introduces a\ntwo-dimensional design space defined by entity structure and service type,\nillustrating how MaaS aligns with current memory practices while naturally\nextending them to cross-entity collaborative scenarios.

Most existing methods of\nefficient garment unfolding overlook the crucial role of standardization of\nflattened garments, which could significantly simplify downstream tasks like\nfolding, ironing, and packing. This paper presents APS-Net, a novel approach to\ngarment manipulation that combines unfolding and standardization in a unified\nframework. APS-Net employs a dual-arm, multi-primitive policy with dynamic\nfling to quickly unfold crumpled garments and pick-and-place (p and p) for\nprecise alignment. The purpose of garment standardization during unfolding\ninvolves not only maximizing surface coverage but also aligning the garment's\nshape and orientation to predefined requirements. To guide effective robot\nlearning, we introduce a novel factorized reward function for standardization,\nwhich incorporates garment coverage (Cov), keypoint distance (KD), and\nintersection-over-union (IoU) metrics. Additionally, we introduce a spatial\naction mask and an Action Optimized Module to improve unfolding efficiency by\nselecting actions and operation points effectively. In simulation, APS-Net\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods for long sleeves, achieving 3.9 percent\nbetter coverage, 5.2 percent higher IoU, and a 0.14 decrease in KD (7.09\npercent relative reduction). Real-world folding tasks further demonstrate that\nstandardization simplifies the folding process.

Regional Climate Models (RCMs) refine this through dynamic\ndownscaling, albeit at considerable computational cost and with limited\nflexibility. While deep learning has emerged as an efficient data-driven\nalternative, most existing studies have focused on single-variable models that\ndownscale one variable at a time. This approach can lead to limited contextual\nawareness, redundant computation, and lack of cross-variable interaction. Our\nstudy addresses these limitations by proposing a multi-task, multi-variable\nVision Transformer (ViT) architecture with a shared encoder and\nvariable-specific decoders (1EMD).

However, current error compensation methods face\nseveral critical challenges, including overly simplified mechanism modeling, a\nlack of physical consistency in data-driven approaches, and substantial data\nrequirements. These issues make it difficult to achieve both high accuracy and\nstrong generalization simultaneously. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes a Spatial-Physical Informed Attention Residual Network (SPI-BoTER).\nThis method integrates the kinematic equations of the robotic manipulator with\na Transformer architecture enhanced by sparse self-attention masks. A\nparameter-adaptive hybrid loss function incorporating spatial and physical\ninformation is employed to iteratively optimize the network during training,\nenabling high-precision error compensation under small-sample conditions.\nAdditionally, inverse joint angle compensation is performed using a gradient\ndescent-based optimization method. Experimental results on a small-sample\ndataset from a UR5 robotic arm (724 samples, with a train:test:validation split\nof 8:1:1) demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. It\nachieves a 3D absolute positioning error of 0.2515 mm with a standard deviation\nof 0.15 mm, representing a 35.16\\% reduction in error compared to conventional\ndeep neural network (DNN) methods.

In this work, we propose\na method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation\nusing weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an\nobject of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more\nquickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the\nsegmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create\nrealistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a\ncontrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose\nto first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create\ncounterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source\nbackgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the\ntraining loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the\nreal object images with backgrounds of the target cluster.

First, novel risk indices are proposed to quantify the\nseverity of continuous power shortages and substantial power fluctuations over\nlong-term operations. These indices are independent of specific scheduling\nstrategies and incorporate the system's resource regulation capabilities. By\nemploying a filtering-based approach, the proposed indices focus on retaining\nkey characteristics of continuous power shortages and fluctuation events,\nenabling the identification of extreme scenarios on long time scales. Secondly,\nan extreme scenario generation method is developed using Gaussian mixture\nmodels and sequential Monte Carlo simulation. Especially, this method\nperiodically evaluates the severity of generated scenarios based on the defined\nrisk indices, retaining extreme scenarios while discarding less critical ones.\nFinally, case studies based on real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of the\nproposed method.

Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction\n(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth\nexploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution\ntransformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a\ntraining-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.\nOur motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise\nstatistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in\nconditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise\nprediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise\nAlignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics\nto domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving\ndomain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we\ndirectly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the\nnoise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the\nmore challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions\ncloser to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of\nsampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions\nprogressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling\nprocess. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA\ncapability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks.

We articulate design pathways\nemphasising collaborative co-design with experts and PWUD to develop LLM\nsystems that are helpful, safe, and responsibly governed. This work contributes\nempirically grounded insights and actionable design considerations for the\nresponsible development of LLMs as supportive tools within the harm reduction\necosystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e3a\u5438\u6bd2\u8005\uff08PWUD\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u5176\u5065\u5eb7\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLMs\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5408\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5728\u7ebf\u6e20\u9053\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u6c61\u540d\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5438\u6bd2\u8005\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u3002LLMs\u4e3a\u6539\u5584\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u4f9b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\uff0c\u6c47\u96c6\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u3001\u51cf\u5bb3\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u793e\u533a\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u7b49\u591a\u5143\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8LLMs\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u6f5c\u5728\u7528\u4f8b\u548c\u6838\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8003\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u90e8\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u969c\u788d\uff08\u5982\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u4f4e\u6c61\u540d\u5316\u4e92\u52a8\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4f26\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u60c5\u5883\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u6c9f\u901a\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u660e\u786e\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fb9\u754c\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u7684\u514b\u670d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u5438\u6bd2\u8005\u5408\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u51cf\u5bb3\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684LLM\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8003\u91cf\u3002"}}

This is particularly useful for achieving adversarial robustness, as\nadversarially training models from scratch is very computationally expensive.\nHowever, high robustness in transfer learning still requires adversarial\ntraining during the fine-tuning phase, which requires up to an order of\nmagnitude more time than standard fine-tuning. In this work, we revisit the use\nof the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) in robust transfer learning to improve\nthe computational cost of adversarial fine-tuning. We surprisingly find that\nFGSM is much more stable in adversarial fine-tuning than when training from\nscratch. In particular, FGSM fine-tuning does not suffer from any issues with\ncatastrophic overfitting at standard perturbation budgets of $\\varepsilon=4$ or\n$\\varepsilon=8$. This stability is further enhanced with parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning methods, where FGSM remains stable even up to $\\varepsilon=32$ for\nlinear probing. We demonstrate how this stability translates into performance\nacross multiple datasets. Compared to fine-tuning with the more commonly used\nmethod of projected gradient descent (PGD), on average, FGSM only loses 0.39%\nand 1.39% test robustness for $\\varepsilon=4$ and $\\varepsilon=8$ while using\n$4\\times$ less training time.

Based on the multi-band thermal\ninfrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation\nImager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we\ndeveloped a high-precision visible light reflectance retrieval model, called\nReflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\\mu\\mathrm{m},\n0.65~\\mu\\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\\mu\\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance\nretrieval at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only\nsignificantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides\nuncertainty estimation. Specifically, the SSIM index of RefDiff can reach 0.90,\nwith particularly significant improvements in areas with complex cloud\nstructures and thick clouds. The model's nighttime retrieval capability was\nvalidated using VIIRS nighttime product, demonstrating comparable performance\nto its daytime counterpart. In summary, this research has made substantial\nprogress in the ability to retrieve visible light reflectance at night, with\nthe potential to expand the application of nighttime visible light data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eFY4B\u536b\u661f\u7684\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86RefDiff\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591c\u95f4\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53cd\u6f14\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u4e91\u7ed3\u6784\u533a\u57df\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591c\u95f4\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5929\u5019\u6c14\u8c61\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eFY4B\u536b\u661f\u7684AGRI\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578bRefDiff\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591c\u95f4\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u53cd\u6f14\u3002", "result": "RefDiff\u7684SSIM\u6307\u6570\u8fbe\u52300.90\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4e91\u7ed3\u6784\u533a\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7VIIRS\u591c\u95f4\u4ea7\u54c1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591c\u95f4\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u53cd\u6f14\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u591c\u95f4\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose StreamFlow, a\nnovel neural architecture that facilitates streaming flow matching with\ndiffusion transformers (DiT). To mitigate the long-sequence extrapolation\nissues arising from lengthy historical dependencies, we design a local\nblock-wise receptive field strategy. Specifically, the sequence is first\nsegmented into blocks, and we introduce block-wise attention masks that enable\nthe current block to receive information from the previous or subsequent block.\nThese attention masks are combined hierarchically across different DiT-blocks\nto regulate the receptive field of DiTs. Both subjective and objective\nexperimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance\ncomparable to non-streaming methods while surpassing other streaming methods in\nterms of speech quality, all the while effectively managing inference time\nduring long-sequence generation. Furthermore, our method achieves a notable\nfirst-packet latency of only 180 ms.\\footnote{Speech samples:\nhttps://dukguo.github.io/StreamFlow/}", "AI": {"tldr": "StreamFlow\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08DiT\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u6d41\u5f0f\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6d41\u5f0f\u8bed\u97f3\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6d41\u5f0f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u9010\u4ee4\u724c\u6d41\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u97f3\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStreamFlow\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u5757\u7ea7\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u8c03\u8282DiT\u7684\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cStreamFlow\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e0e\u975e\u6d41\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6d41\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u9996\u6b21\u5305\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ec5180\u6beb\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "StreamFlow\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6d41\u5f0f\u8bed\u97f3\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u97f3\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3002"}}

The proposed LLC scheme treats desired harmonic load limits as limit\nboundaries and recasts the problem of load limiting as a vehicle limit by\ncomputing a Control Margin (CM) using a limit detection and avoidance module.\nThe computed CM is used as a cue to the pilot. The limit detection and\navoidance module comprises an optimization algorithm, a model predictive\ncontroller, and a computationally simple on-board dynamical model. Simulations\nwere conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the LLC scheme in limiting\nharmonic pitch link loads during flight. One significant outcome is that, with\nsufficient training, the pilot can skillfully track the cue within 0.5 seconds\nof initiating the tracking task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u76f4\u5347\u673a\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u4ef6\u5bff\u547d\u5ef6\u957f\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u5ffd\u7565\u8c10\u6ce2\u8f7d\u8377\u75b2\u52b3\u635f\u4f24\u548c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u673a\u52a8\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5bff\u547d\u5ef6\u957f\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8c10\u6ce2\u8f7d\u8377\u75b2\u52b3\u635f\u4f24\u548c\u673a\u52a8\u52a8\u4f5c\u533a\u5206\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8d1f\u8f7d\u9650\u5236\u63a7\u5236\uff08LLC\uff09\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u8c10\u6ce2\u8d1f\u8f7d\u9650\u5236\u89c6\u4e3a\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u63a7\u5236\u88d5\u5ea6\uff08CM\uff09\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u98de\u884c\u5458\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793aLLC\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9650\u5236\u98de\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u8c10\u6ce2\u6868\u8ddd\u8fde\u6746\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u98de\u884c\u5458\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u53ef\u57280.5\u79d2\u5185\u719f\u7ec3\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "LLC\u65b9\u6848\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u76f4\u5347\u673a\u90e8\u4ef6\u7684\u5bff\u547d\u5ef6\u957f\u63a7\u5236\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, it remains unclear whether these\nimprovements are driven by major changes in transformer layers or from minor\nadjustments that leave the relative layer importance structures of the base\nmodel largely unchanged. We investigate this question through systematic\nlayer-wise ablation experiments, examining base, instruction-tuned,\nknowledge-distilled, and reinforcement learning variants on mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that mathematical reasoning gives rise\nto a specific layer importance structure, and this structure persists across\nall post-training paradigms.

In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video\nobject detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways.\nFirst, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens,\nwe can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with\ndiverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in\nthe training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all\npossible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual\nproblems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing\nduring inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as\nfully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating\nimage-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video\nobject, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale\neffortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the\nlength of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even\ngeneralizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire\nvideo. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector\non several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with\nstrong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We\nalso compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is\ncompetitive with the current state of the art even with the computational\nbottleneck.

These limitations hinder the\ndevelopment of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained\nfrom scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical\nfoundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation.\nRather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge\nfrom nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP\nmodels, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our\ntwo-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9\nmillion biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by\nfeature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from\nteacher models.

We call this model the Residual Matrix\nTransformer (RMT). We find that the RMT enjoys a number of attractive\nproperties: 1) the size of the residual stream can be scaled independently of\ncompute and model size, improving performance, 2) the RMT can achieve the same\nloss as the transformer with 58% fewer FLOPS, 25% fewer parameters, and 41%\nfewer training tokens tokens, and 3) the RMT outperforms the transformer on\ndownstream evaluations. We theoretically analyze the transformer and the RMT,\nand show that the RMT allows for more efficient scaling of the residual stream,\nas well as improved variance propagation properties.

In a simulated P2P\nmicrogrid with multiple sellers and buyers, the LLM acts as a real-time\nfairness critic, evaluating each trading episode using two metrics:\nFairness-To-Buyer (FTB) and Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS). These fairness\nscores are integrated into agent rewards through scheduled\n{\\lambda}-coefficients, forming an adaptive LLM-guided reward shaping loop that\nreplaces brittle, rule-based fairness constraints. Agents are trained using\nIndependent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) and achieve equitable outcomes,\nfulfilling over 90% of buyer demand, maintaining fair seller margins, and\nconsistently reaching FTB and FBS scores above 0.80. The training process\ndemonstrates that fairness feedback improves convergence, reduces buyer\nshortfalls, and narrows profit disparities between sellers. With its\nlanguage-based critic, the framework scales naturally, and its extension to a\nlarge power distribution system with household prosumers illustrates its\npractical applicability. FairMarket-RL thus offers a scalable, equity-driven\nsolution for autonomous trading in decentralized energy systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "FairMarket-RL\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u7684P2P\u4ea4\u6613\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u516c\u5e73\u8bc4\u5206\u4f18\u5316\u4ea4\u6613\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709P2P\u4ea4\u6613\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\uff0cFairMarket-RL\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u548cRL\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u516c\u5e73\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ea4\u6613\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7FTB\u548cFBS\u8bc4\u5206\u4f18\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u6a21\u62dfP2P\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b090%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u4e70\u5bb6\u9700\u6c42\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\u4e8e0.80\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5229\u6da6\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "FairMarket-RL\u4e3a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ea4\u6613\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unlike structured or\nsemi-structured documents, text on maps varies significantly in orientation,\nreading order, shape, and placement. Many modern methods can detect and\ntranscribe text regions, but they struggle to effectively ``link'' the\nrecognized text fragments, e.g., determining a multi-word place name. Existing\nlayout analysis methods model word relationships to improve text understanding\nin structured documents, but they primarily rely on linguistic features and\nneglect geometric information, which is essential for handling map text. To\naddress these challenges, we propose LIGHT, a novel multi-modal approach that\nintegrates linguistic, image, and geometric features for linking text on\nhistorical maps. In particular, LIGHT includes a geometry-aware embedding\nmodule that encodes the polygonal coordinates of text regions to capture\npolygon shapes and their relative spatial positions on an image. LIGHT unifies\nthis geometric information with the visual and linguistic token embeddings from\nLayoutLMv3, a pretrained layout analysis model. LIGHT uses the cross-modal\ninformation to predict the reading-order successor of each text instance\ndirectly with a bi-directional learning strategy that enhances sequence\nrobustness.

In contrast to the time-invariant case, the time-varying LQ problem\ninvolves a differential Riccati equation (DRE) with time-dependent parameters\nand terminal boundary constraints. We formulate the LQ problem as a nonconvex\noptimization problem and conduct a rigorous analysis of its dual structure. By\nexploiting the inherent convexity of the dual problem and analyzing the KKT\nconditions, we derive an explicit relationship between the optimal dual\nsolution and the parameters of the associated Q-function in time-varying case.\nThis theoretical insight supports the development of a novel, sample-efficient,\nnon-iterative semidefinite programming (SDP) algorithm that directly computes\nthe optimal sequence of feedback gains from an ensemble of input-state data\nsequences without model identification. The resulting convex, data-dependent\nframework provides global optimality guarantees for completely unknown LTV\nsystems. As a special case, the method also applies to finite-horizon LQ\ncontrol of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. In this setting, a single\ninput-state trajectory suffices to identify the optimal LQ feedback policy,\nimproving significantly over existing Q-learning approaches for finite horizon\nLTI systems that typically require data from multiple episodes. The approach\nprovides a new optimization-based perspective on Q-learning in time-varying\nsettings and contributes to the broader understanding of data-driven control in\nnon-stationary environments.

To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce\nBrainMT, a novel hybrid framework designed to efficiently learn and integrate\nlong-range spatiotemporal attributes in fMRI data.

Therefore, effective data recovery methods are\nessential to ensure the reliability of downstream data-driven applications.\nwhile classical tensor completion methods have been widely adopted, they are\nincapable of modeling noise, making them unsuitable for complex scenarios\ninvolving simultaneous data missingness and noise interference. Existing Robust\nTensor Completion (RTC) approaches offer potential solutions by separately\nmodeling the actual tensor data and noise.

However,\nthe high relative velocity of LEO satellites induces significant Doppler shifts\nthat disrupt subcarrier orthogonality and degrade multicarrier system\nperformance. While the common time-varying Doppler shift can be compensated\nrelative to a reference point, the residual differential Doppler across users\nwithin the coverage cell remains a significant challenge, causing severe\nintercarrier interference. This paper presents a generalized analytical\nframework for characterizing both the Doppler shift magnitude and the\ndifferential Doppler in LEO systems. Unlike prior works limited by flat-Earth\nassumptions or specific orbital configurations, our model incorporates Earth's\ncurvature and supports arbitrary elevation angles. Using spherical geometry, we\nderive closed-form expressions for Doppler shift based on the central angle\nbetween the satellite and ground users. We further provide a statistical\ncharacterization of both the Doppler shift magnitude and the differential\nDoppler in terms of their cumulative distribution function (CDF) and\nprobability density function (PDF) for uniformly distributed users within a\nspherical cap cell. Additionally, we derive a tight upper bound for the Doppler\nshift CDF and an exact expression for the maximum differential Doppler\nexperienced across the coverage region. To mitigate intra-cell Doppler\nvariation, we implement a user clustering technique that partitions the\ncoverage area based on a Doppler disparity threshold into spherical sub-cells,\nensuring compliance with 3GPP tolerances.

Avocados present unique challenges owing to their irregular shape,\nweight, and less-structured growing environments, which require specific\nviewpoints for successful harvesting. We propose a geometry-based,\nsemantics-aware viewpoint-planning algorithm to address these challenges. The\nplanning process involves three key steps: viewpoint sampling, evaluation, and\nexecution. Starting from a partially occluded view, the system first detects\nthe fruit, then leverages geometric information to constrain the viewpoint\nsearch space to a 1D circle, and uniformly samples four points to balance the\nefficiency and exploration.

Specifically, we consider a multiagent network that is composed of\nleader and follower nodes over a time-varying, connected, and undirected graph.\nIn contrast to existing works on the event-triggered distributed control\nliterature, we propose a time-varying edge weight event-triggered control\nframework.

We analyze how AI\ndecision-support systems affect two key components of domain-specific autonomy:\nskilled competence (the ability to make informed judgments within one's domain)\nand authentic value-formation (the capacity to form genuine domain-relevant\nvalues and preferences). By engaging with prior investigations and analyzing\nempirical cases across medical, financial, and educational domains, we\ndemonstrate how the absence of reliable failure indicators and the potential\nfor unconscious value shifts can erode domain-specific autonomy both\nimmediately and over time.

In this paper, we present a method to solve\nthese two problems jointly from a sequence of observed point clouds of a single\narticulated object. The main challenge in our problem setting is that the point\nclouds are not assumed to be generated by a fixed set of moving points.\nInstead, each point cloud in the sequence could be an arbitrary sampling of the\nobject surface at that particular time step. Such scenarios occur when the\nobject undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using\nmeasurements from multiple sensors asynchronously. In these scenarios, methods\nthat rely on tracking point correspondences are not appropriate. We present an\nalternative approach based on a compact but effective representation where we\nrepresent the object as a collection of simple building blocks modeled as 3D\nGaussians. We parameterize the Gaussians with time-dependent rotations,\ntranslations, and scales that are shared across all time steps. With our\nrepresentation, part segmentation can be achieved by building correspondences\nbetween the observed points and the Gaussians. Moreover, the transformation of\neach point across time can be obtained by following the poses of the assigned\nGaussian (even when the point is not observed). Experiments show that our\nmethod outperforms existing methods that solely rely on finding point\ncorrespondences. Additionally, we extend existing datasets to emulate\nreal-world scenarios by considering viewpoint occlusions. We further\ndemonstrate that our method is more robust to missing points as compared to\nexisting approaches on these challenging datasets, even when some parts are\ncompletely occluded in some time-steps.

The\nrecurrent architecture of the neural network means that the entire past can\ninfluence current migration patterns, allowing us to learn long-range temporal\ncorrelations. By training an ensemble of neural networks and additionally\npushing uncertainty on the covariates through the trained network, we obtain\nconfidence bounds for all our estimates, allowing researchers to pinpoint the\ngeographic regions most in need of additional data collection. We validate our\napproach on various test sets of unseen data, demonstrating that it\nsignificantly outperforms traditional methods estimating five-year flows while\ndelivering a significant increase in temporal resolution. The model is fully\nopen source: all training data, neural network weights, and training code are\nmade public alongside the migration estimates, providing a valuable resource\nfor future studies of human migration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e1990\u5e74\u81f3\u4eca230\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u4e0e\u5730\u533a\u95f4\u5e74\u5ea6\u79fb\u6c11\u6d41\u52a8\u4e0e\u5b58\u91cf\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc1\u79fb\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u9762\u7684\u79fb\u6c11\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7ed3\u540818\u79cd\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u751f\u6210\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u79fb\u6c11\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9d\u8d35\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

This method avoids the inefficiency and inflated region sizes\nassociated with sampling and ensembling.

However,\nmost current escorting robots primarily rely on navigation-focused strategies,\nassuming that the person being escorted will follow without issue. In crowded\nenvironments, this assumption often falls short, as individuals may struggle to\nkeep pace, become obstructed, get distracted, or need to stop unexpectedly. As\na result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective\nescorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement\ndynamics. To address these challenges, an effective escorting robot must\ncontinuously detect and interpret human actions during the escorting process\nand adjust its movement accordingly.

Third, we propose two coarse attribute\nup-sampling methods, Geometric Distance Weighted Attribute Interpolation\n(GDWAI) and Deep Learning-based Attribute Interpolation (DLAI), to generate\ncoarse up-sampled attributes for each point. Then, an attribute enhancement\nmodule is introduced to refine these up-sampled attributes and produce\nhigh-quality point clouds by further exploiting intrinsic attribute and\ngeometry patterns. Extensive experiments show that the Peak Signal-to-Noise\nRatio (PSNR) achieved by the proposed JGAU method is 33.90 decibels, 32.10\ndecibels, 31.10 decibels, and 30.39 decibels for up-sampling rates of 4 times,\n8 times, 12 times, and 16 times, respectively. Compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods, JGAU achieves average PSNR gains of 2.32 decibels, 2.47 decibels, 2.28\ndecibels, and 2.11 decibels at these four up-sampling rates, demonstrating\nsignificant improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8054\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08JGAU\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e14\u66f4\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u5f69\u8272\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f69\u8272\u70b9\u4e91\u662f\u73b0\u5b9e\u548c\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f3D\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4e3b\u6d41\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5bc6\u96c6\u70b9\u4e91\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faJGAU\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21\u5c5e\u6027\u90bb\u57df\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u7c97\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u57284\u500d\u30018\u500d\u300112\u500d\u548c16\u500d\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u4e0b\uff0cPSNR\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523033.90\u300132.10\u300131.10\u548c30.39\u5206\u8d1d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53472.11\u81f32.47\u5206\u8d1d\u3002", "conclusion": "JGAU\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f69\u8272\u70b9\u4e91\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u70b9\u4e91\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, their proficiency in these high-level applications\noften assumes a deep understanding of low-level physical prerequisites, a\ncapability that remains largely unverified. For robots to perform actions\nreliably, they must comprehend intrinsic object properties (e.g., material,\nweight), action affordances (e.g., graspable, stackable), and physical\nconstraints (e.g., stability, reachability, or an object's state, such as being\nclosed). Despite the widespread use of VLMs in manipulation tasks, we argue\nthat off-the-shelf models may lack this granular, physically grounded\nunderstanding, as such prerequisites are often overlooked during training.\n  To address this critical gap, we introduce PAC Bench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLMs on their understanding of\ncore Properties, Affordances, and Constraints (PAC) from a task executability\nperspective.

This separate\nencoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically,\nthese methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often\nrequiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability.\nInspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g.\nMatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the\ndetector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and\ncamera views. Specifically, we project the LiDAR intensity map into a 2D view\nfrom the LiDAR perspective and feed it into an attention-based detector-free\nmatching network, enabling cross-modal correspondence estimation without\nrelying on multi-frame accumulation. To further enhance matching reliability,\nwe introduce a repeatability scoring mechanism that acts as a soft visibility\nprior.

We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models\nthe PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be\nadded on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely\n(explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we\ntake derivatives for the PDE loss. Using BWLer, we identify fundamental\nprecision limitations within the MLP: on a simple 1-D interpolation task, even\nMLPs with O(1e5) parameters stall around 1e-8 RMSE -- about eight orders above\nfloat64 machine precision -- before any PDE terms are added. In PDE learning,\nadding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable\naccuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully\ncharacterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it\nduring training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five\nbenchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for\nconvection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining\ncompatible with first-order optimizers. Replacing the MLP entirely lets an\nexplicit BWLer reach near-machine-precision on convection, reaction, and wave\nproblems (up to 10 billion times better than prior results) and match the\nperformance of standard PINNs on stiff Burgers' and irregular-geometry Poisson\nproblems.

To address this, this paper introduces a\nfeature-wise mixing framework to mitigate contextual bias. This was done by\nredistributing feature representations across multiple contextual datasets. To\nassess feature-wise mixing's effectiveness, four ML classifiers were trained\nusing cross-validation and evaluated with bias-sensitive loss functions,\nincluding disparity metrics and mean squared error (MSE), which served as a\nstandard measure of predictive performance. The proposed method achieved an\naverage bias reduction of 43.35% and a statistically significant decrease in\nMSE across all classifiers trained on mixed datasets.

Along with a sampling strategy adopted\nfrom image restoration and a new denoiser architecture, Double-Diffusion ranks\nfirst in most evaluation scenarios across two real-life datasets compared with\nother probabilistic models, it also cuts inference time by 50% to 30% while\nenjoying an increase between 3-12% in Continuous Ranked Probabilistic Score\n(CRPS).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDouble-Diffusion\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5df2\u77e5\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6027\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u7a7a\u6c14\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a7a\u6c14\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u7a7a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDouble-Diffusion\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u77e5\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u65b0\u53bb\u566a\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1150%\u81f330%\uff0cCRPS\u63d0\u53473-12%\u3002", "conclusion": "Double-Diffusion\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7a7a\u6c14\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To tackle this fine-grained task, most\nexisting methods focus on extracting regional features to enrich attribute\ninformation. However, a regional feature is typically used to predict a fixed\nset of pre-defined attributes in these methods, which limits the performance\nand practicality in two aspects: 1) Regional features may compromise\nfine-grained patterns unique to certain attributes in favor of capturing common\ncharacteristics shared across attributes. 2) Regional features cannot\ngeneralize to predict unseen attributes in the test time. In this paper, we\npropose the \\textbf{F}ine-grained \\textbf{O}ptimization with semanti\\textbf{C}\ng\\textbf{U}ided under\\textbf{S}tanding (FOCUS) approach for PAR, which\nadaptively extracts fine-grained attribute-level features for each attribute\nindividually, regardless of whether the attributes are seen or not during\ntraining. Specifically, we propose the Multi-Granularity Mix Tokens (MGMT) to\ncapture latent features at varying levels of visual granularity, thereby\nenriching the diversity of the extracted information. Next, we introduce the\nAttribute-guided Visual Feature Extraction (AVFE) module, which leverages\ntextual attributes as queries to retrieve their corresponding visual attribute\nfeatures from the Mix Tokens using a cross-attention mechanism. To ensure that\ntextual attributes focus on the appropriate Mix Tokens, we further incorporate\na Region-Aware Contrastive Learning (RACL) method, encouraging attributes\nwithin the same region to share consistent attention maps.

In reality, what appears as a drifting causal mechanism is\noften the manifestation of a fixed underlying mechanism seen through a narrow\nobservational window. This brings about a problem that, when building a world\nmodel, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very\nobserved causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \\textbf{Meta-Causal\nGraph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently\nencodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across\ndifferent latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of\nmultiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent\nstate space. Building on this representation, we introduce a\n\\textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta\nstates that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal\nrelationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3)\niteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven\nexploration and agent experiences.

To address this\ngap, we developed Generative Attribution Metric Analysis (GAMA), an attribution\nmethod for autoregressive generative models based on Integrated Gradients. We\nassessed GAMA using synthetic datasets with known ground truths to characterize\nits statistical behavior and validate its ability to recover biologically\nrelevant features.

This approach enables the estimation of relational semantic\nsimilarity; however, it remains unclear whether it can also represent absolute\nsemantic informativeness. In this work, we introduce a semantic informativeness\nmetric for an image calculated from text samples via a contrastive learning\nmodel; similarly, the informativeness of a text is calculated from image\nsamples. We propose a redefinition of the concept of Information Gain, a\nconcept previously explored in natural language processing, extending its\napplication to the domains of vision and language. Our metric quantifies how\nconditioning on an image distorts the distribution of associated texts, and\nvice versa for text conditioning on image distributions.

However, in CP, an ego agent needs\nto receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to\nattacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a\nunified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-Guard, which\nis a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately\ndetect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key\nidea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego\nagent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a\nprobability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a\nsubset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior\nprobabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative\nconsistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV)\nsegmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its\ncollaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In\naddition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to\ndynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the\nreliability of the systems in dynamic environments.

In this paper, we present\nSub-MoE, a novel MoE compression framework via Subspace Expert Merging. Our key\ninsight is to perform joint Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on concatenated\nexpert weights, reducing conflicting parameters by extracting shared\n$U$-matrices while enabling effective merging of the expert-specific $V$\ncomponents. Specifically, Sub-MoE consists of two innovative phases: (1)\nAdaptive Expert Clustering, which groups functionally coherent experts via\nK-means clustering based on cosine similarity of expert outputs; and (2)\nSubspace Expert Merging, which first enforces Experts Union Decomposition to\nderive the shared $U$-matrix across experts in the same group, then pursues\nfrequency-based merging for individual $V$-matrices, and finalizes expert\nreconstruction using the merged $V$-matrix. In this way, we align and fuse\nexperts in a shared subspace, and can be extended with intra-expert compression\nfor further inference optimization.

In VPT, we uncover\n``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch\nembeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's\nself-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key\nand query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution,\nrespectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for\nlearning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data,\nde-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before\nlearning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch\nembeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt\nto be learned in a bilinear manner. Surprisingly, this method significantly\naccelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., $>$25 accuracy points on\nthe CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns ``bursty prompts''. Extending the\nbilinear model which is known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact,\nlow-rank version by learning two smaller matrices whose multiplication yields\nthe final prompts.

Current deep\nlearning algorithms usually solve for the optimal classifier by\n\\emph{implicitly} estimating the posterior probabilities, \\emph{e.g.}, by\nminimizing the Softmax cross-entropy loss. This simple methodology has been\nproven effective for meticulously balanced academic benchmark datasets.\nHowever, it is not applicable to the long-tailed data distributions in the real\nworld, where it leads to the gradient imbalance issue and fails to ensure the\nBayes optimal decision rule. To address these challenges, this paper presents a\nnovel approach (BAPE) that provides a more precise theoretical estimation of\nthe data distributions by \\emph{explicitly} modeling the parameters of the\nposterior probabilities and solving them with point estimation. Consequently,\nour method directly learns the Bayes classifier without gradient descent based\non Bayes' theorem, simultaneously alleviating the gradient imbalance and\nensuring the Bayes optimal decision rule. Furthermore, we propose a\nstraightforward yet effective \\emph{distribution adjustment} technique.

Key to this is the modeling and generation of hierarchical data that\nrepresents the intrinsic structure within datasets. Traditional methods face\nlimitations in terms of computational cost, performance, generative capacity,\nand stability. Recent VAEs based approaches have made strides in addressing\nthese challenges but still require specialized network modules for each tree\nbranch, limiting their stability and ability to capture deep hierarchical\nrelationships. To overcome these challenges, we introduce diffusion-based\napproach called HDTree. HDTree captures tree relationships within a\nhierarchical latent space using a unified hierarchical codebook and quantized\ndiffusion processes to model tree node transitions. This method improves\nstability by eliminating branch-specific modules and enhancing generative\ncapacity through gradual hierarchical changes simulated by the diffusion\nprocess.

Recently, pretrained vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) such as CLIP have been leveraged in GFSS to improve\ngeneralization on novel classes through multi-modal prototypes learning.\nHowever, existing prototype-based methods are inherently deterministic,\nlimiting the adaptability of learned prototypes to diverse samples,\nparticularly for novel classes with scarce annotations. To address this, we\npropose FewCLIP, a probabilistic prototype calibration framework over\nmulti-modal prototypes from the pretrained CLIP, thus providing more adaptive\nprototype learning for GFSS. Specifically, FewCLIP first introduces a prototype\ncalibration mechanism, which refines frozen textual prototypes with learnable\nvisual calibration prototypes, leading to a more discriminative and adaptive\nrepresentation. Furthermore, unlike deterministic prototype learning\ntechniques, FewCLIP introduces distribution regularization over these\ncalibration prototypes. This probabilistic formulation ensures structured and\nuncertainty-aware prototype learning, effectively mitigating overfitting to\nlimited novel class data while enhancing generalization. Extensive experimental\nresults on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets demonstrate that our proposed\nFewCLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across both GFSS\nand class-incremental setting.

Additive noise models (ANMs) are widely used to enable\nsample-efficient bivariate causal discovery.

This paper makes three key contributions: first, we rigorously\ncharacterize why standard ANM approaches break down in the presence of\nunmeasured mediators. Second, we demonstrate that prior solutions for hidden\nmediation are brittle in finite sample settings, limiting their practical\nutility. To address these gaps, we propose Bivariate Denoising Diffusion (BiDD)\nfor causal discovery, a method designed to handle latent noise introduced by\nunmeasured mediators. Unlike prior methods that infer directionality through\nmean squared error loss comparisons, our approach introduces a novel\nindependence test statistic: during the noising and denoising processes for\neach variable, we condition on the other variable as input and evaluate the\nindependence of the predicted noise relative to this input. We prove asymptotic\nconsistency of BiDD under the ANM, and conjecture that it performs well under\nhidden mediation.

However, they confront the\ntug-of-war problem between two distinct types of anomalies, resulting in\nsuboptimal performance. This work presents TripleAD, a mutual\ndistillation-based triple-channel graph anomaly detection framework. It\nincludes three estimation modules to identify the attribute, structural, and\nmixed anomalies while mitigating the interference between different types of\nanomalies. In the first channel, we design a multiscale attribute estimation\nmodule to capture extensive node interactions and ameliorate the over-smoothing\nissue. To better identify structural anomalies, we introduce a link-enhanced\nstructure estimation module in the second channel that facilitates information\nflow to topologically isolated nodes.

Concurrently, autoregressive (AR) models, particularly those\ngenerating continuous tokens, have emerged as a promising direction for\nunifying text and media generation. This paper introduces Transition Matching\n(TM), a novel discrete-time, continuous-state generative paradigm that unifies\nand advances both diffusion/flow models and continuous AR generation. TM\ndecomposes complex generation tasks into simpler Markov transitions, allowing\nfor expressive non-deterministic probability transition kernels and arbitrary\nnon-continuous supervision processes, thereby unlocking new flexible design\navenues. We explore these choices through three TM variants: (i) Difference\nTransition Matching (DTM), which generalizes flow matching to discrete-time by\ndirectly learning transition probabilities, yielding state-of-the-art image\nquality and text adherence as well as improved sampling efficiency. (ii)\nAutoregressive Transition Matching (ARTM) and (iii) Full History Transition\nMatching (FHTM) are partially and fully causal models, respectively, that\ngeneralize continuous AR methods.

To effectively\naddress the above issues, this paper proposes a Nonlinear Low-rank\nRepresentation model (NLR) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for\nimputing missing WQD, which utilizes CNNs to implement two ideas: a) fusing\ntemporal features to model the temporal dependence of data between time slots,\nand b) Extracting nonlinear interactions and local patterns to mine\nhigher-order relationships features and achieve deep fusion of multidimensional\ninformation. Experimental studies on three real water quality datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art data imputation models in terms of estimation accuracy.

Due to the small size and high\nintra-class variability of plaque, CPG is commonly evaluated using a\ncombination of transverse and longitudinal ultrasound views in clinical\npractice. However, most existing deep learning-based multi-view classification\nmethods focus on feature fusion across different views, neglecting the\nimportance of representation learning and the difference in class features. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel Corpus-View-Category Refinement\nFramework (CVC-RF) that processes information from Corpus-, View-, and\nCategory-levels, enhancing model performance. Our contribution is four-fold.\nFirst, to the best of our knowledge, we are the foremost deep learning-based\nmethod for CPG according to the latest Carotid Plaque-RADS guidelines. Second,\nwe propose a novel center-memory contrastive loss, which enhances the network's\nglobal modeling capability by comparing with representative cluster centers and\ndiverse negative samples at the Corpus level. Third, we design a cascaded\ndown-sampling attention module to fuse multi-scale information and achieve\nimplicit feature interaction at the View level. Finally, a parameter-free\nmixture-of-experts weighting strategy is introduced to leverage class\nclustering knowledge to weight different experts, enabling feature decoupling\nat the Category level.

To circumvent\nthese costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated\nimages as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a\nvaluable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when\nthese images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable\ndetection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable\nin the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity.\nWe analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion\nmodels (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing\nwatermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are\neither erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the\nnoising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space).

While existing graph-aware calibration methods seek\nto mitigate this limitation, they primarily depend on coarse one-hop\nstatistics, such as neighbor-predicted confidence, or latent node embeddings,\nthereby neglecting the fine-grained structural heterogeneity inherent in graph\ntopology.

When the camera motion range becomes\nlimited or even stationary (i.e., small camera motion), existing methods\nencounter two primary challenges: incorrect representation of scene geometry\nand inaccurate estimation of camera parameters. These challenges make prior\nmethods struggle to produce satisfactory results or even become invalid. To\naddress the first challenge, we propose a novel Distribution-based Depth\nRegularization (DDR) that ensures the rendering weight distribution to align\nwith the true distribution. Specifically, unlike previous methods that use\ndepth loss to calculate the error of the expectation, we calculate the\nexpectation of the error by using Gumbel-softmax to differentiably sample\npoints from discrete rendering weight distribution. Additionally, we introduce\nconstraints that enforce the volume density of spatial points before the object\nboundary along the ray to be near zero, ensuring that our model learns the\ncorrect geometry of the scene. To demystify the DDR, we further propose a\nvisualization tool that enables observing the scene geometry representation at\nthe rendering weight level.

Typically, existing methods adopt unified\nrepresentation model (e.g., Gaussian) to directly match the spatiotemporal\nfeatures of dynamic scene from frame camera. However, this unified paradigm\nfails in the potential discontinuous temporal features of objects due to frame\nimaging and the heterogeneous spatial features between background and objects.\nTo address this issue, we disentangle the spatiotemporal features into various\nlatent representations to alleviate the spatiotemporal mismatching between\nbackground and objects. In this work, we introduce event camera to compensate\nfor frame camera, and propose a spatiotemporal-disentangled Gaussian splatting\nframework for high-dynamic scene reconstruction. As for dynamic scene, we\nfigure out that background and objects have appearance discrepancy in\nframe-based spatial features and motion discrepancy in event-based temporal\nfeatures, which motivates us to distinguish the spatiotemporal features between\nbackground and objects via clustering. As for dynamic object, we discover that\nGaussian representations and event data share the consistent spatiotemporal\ncharacteristic, which could serve as a prior to guide the spatiotemporal\ndisentanglement of object Gaussians.

However, these approaches fail to explicitly model the\noptimal global transport path, leading to suboptimal completions. Moreover,\nperforming diffusion directly in voxel space imposes resolution constraints,\nlimiting the generation of fine-grained geometric details. To address these\nchallenges, we propose BridgeShape, a novel framework for 3D shape completion\nvia latent diffusion Schr\\\"odinger bridge. The key innovations lie in two\naspects: (i) BridgeShape formulates shape completion as an optimal transport\nproblem, explicitly modeling the transition between incomplete and complete\nshapes to ensure a globally coherent transformation.

However, the heavy\nreliance of existing systems on photometric rendering loss for camera tracking\nundermines their robustness, especially in unbounded outdoor environments with\nsevere viewpoint and illumination changes. To address these challenges, we\npropose TVG-SLAM, a robust RGB-only 3DGS SLAM system that leverages a novel\ntri-view geometry paradigm to ensure consistent tracking and high-quality\nmapping. We introduce a dense tri-view matching module that aggregates reliable\npairwise correspondences into consistent tri-view matches, forming robust\ngeometric constraints across frames. For tracking, we propose Hybrid Geometric\nConstraints, which leverage tri-view matches to construct complementary\ngeometric cues alongside photometric loss, ensuring accurate and stable pose\nestimation even under drastic viewpoint shifts and lighting variations. For\nmapping, we propose a new probabilistic initialization strategy that encodes\ngeometric uncertainty from tri-view correspondences into newly initialized\nGaussians. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Attenuation of Rendering Trust\nmechanism to mitigate tracking drift caused by mapping latency. Experiments on\nmultiple public outdoor datasets show that our TVG-SLAM outperforms prior\nRGB-only 3DGS-based SLAM systems. Notably, in the most challenging dataset, our\nmethod improves tracking robustness, reducing the average Absolute Trajectory\nError (ATE) by 69.0\\% while achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality.

However, these approaches often lack\ngeneralizability, adaptability and tend to be overly conservative, resulting in\nineffective repairs that not only fail to mitigate safety risks sufficiently\nbut also degrade the overall driving experience. To address this issue, we\npropose Adaptive Decision Repair (ADReFT), a novel and effective repair method\nthat identifies safety-critical states through offline learning from failed\ntests and generates appropriate mitigation actions to improve ADS safety.\nSpecifically, ADReFT incorporates a transformer-based model with two joint\nheads, State Monitor and Decision Adapter, designed to capture complex driving\nenvironment interactions to evaluate state safety severity and generate\nadaptive repair actions. Given the absence of oracles for state safety\nidentification, we first pretrain ADReFT using supervised learning with coarse\nannotations, i.e., labeling states preceding violations as positive samples and\nothers as negative samples. It establishes ADReFT's foundational capability to\nmitigate safety-critical violations, though it may result in somewhat\nconservative mitigation strategies.

These problems hinder fair comparisons\nbetween TTA methods and obscure their practical strengths and weaknesses. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for\nevaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7\nonline TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates\nthem across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on\nCLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid\nloss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA\nto assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates\nvarious evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration,\nout-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic\nassessment of TTA methods.

However, their scalability remains a problem due to the huge\ncommunication cost among parallel processes. Most of the existing communication\nlatency analysis methods rely on the physical link layer information, which is\nonly available to administrators. In this paper, a framework called PCLVis is\nproposed to help general users analyze process communication latency (PCL)\nevents. Instead of the physical link layer information, the PCLVis uses the MPI\nprocess communication data for the analysis. First, a spatial PCL event\nlocating method is developed. All processes with high correlation are\nclassified into a single cluster by constructing a process-correlation tree.\nSecond, the propagation path of PCL events is analyzed by constructing a\ncommunication-dependency-based directed acyclic graph (DAG), which can help\nusers interactively explore a PCL event from the temporal evolution of a\nlocated PCL event cluster. In this graph, a sliding window algorithm is\ndesigned to generate the PCL events abstraction. Meanwhile, a new glyph called\nthe communication state glyph (CS-Glyph) is designed for each process to show\nits communication states, including its in/out messages and load balance.

Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less\nexplored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective\nvisualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that\nproduce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively,\nwhere each generated token depends on the previous context. Therefore, earlier\ncontext tokens can introduce redundant activations that interfere with the\nexplanation of later tokens beyond their original information. Existing studies\noften overlook this issue, but our observations reveal that these redundant\ncorrelations can significantly hurt the reliability of explanations. To address\nthis, we propose an estimated causal inference method to mitigate the\ninterference of context to achieve high-quality MLLM explanation, with a novel\nrank Gaussian filter to further reduce activation noises. We term this method\nToken Activation Map (TAM) to highlight the consideration of interactions\nbetween tokens.

In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly\ndistributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance.\nSpecifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads\nto a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by\n$h_{\\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\\min}$ can slow down the training\ndynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the\napproximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\\min}$ increases. Our\nanalysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent\nKernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including\ntransformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness.

Existing consistent methods often focus on a specific domain with\nspecific aspects of consistency, which significantly constrains their\ngeneralizability to broader applications. In this paper, we propose a more\nchallenging problem, Text-to-ImageSet (T2IS) generation, which aims to generate\nsets of images that meet various consistency requirements based on user\ninstructions. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce\n$\\textbf{T2IS-Bench}$ with 596 diverse instructions across 26 subcategories,\nproviding comprehensive coverage for T2IS generation. Building on this, we\npropose $\\textbf{T2IS-Eval}$, an evaluation framework that transforms user\ninstructions into multifaceted assessment criteria and employs effective\nevaluators to adaptively assess consistency fulfillment between criteria and\ngenerated sets. Subsequently, we propose $\\textbf{AutoT2IS}$, a training-free\nframework that maximally leverages pretrained Diffusion Transformers'\nin-context capabilities to harmonize visual elements to satisfy both\nimage-level prompt alignment and set-level visual consistency.

Although existing deepfake detection\nmodels demonstrate outstanding performance in detection metrics, most methods\nonly provide simple binary classification results, lacking interpretability. In\ncritical domains such as law, interpretability is crucial for enhancing the\ncredibility and authority of decisions. Recent studies attempt to improve the\ninterpretability of classification results by providing spatial manipulation\nmasks or temporal forgery segments.

Most\ncurrent deepfake datasets predominantly offer binary labels, only a few\ndatasets with localization annotations.

A prevalent issue in compositional generation is the misalignment\nof spatial relationships, as models often fail to faithfully generate images\nthat reflect the spatial configurations specified between objects in the input\nprompts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework\nfor modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging\nthe concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS). Building on this insight, we\nmake two key contributions. First, we introduce a novel evaluation metric,\nPoS-based Evaluation (PSE), designed to assess the alignment of 2D and 3D\nspatial relationships between text and image, with improved adherence to human\njudgment. Second, we propose PoS-based Generation (PSG), an inference-time\nmethod that improves the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships in T2I\nmodels without requiring fine-tuning. PSG employs a Part-of-Speech PoS-based\nreward function that can be utilized in two distinct ways: (1) as a\ngradient-based guidance mechanism applied to the cross-attention maps during\nthe denoising steps, or (2) as a search-based strategy that evaluates a set of\ninitial noise vectors to select the best one.

First, label sanitization\nis performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,\nand surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing\nimage-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.\nSecond, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,\nfollowed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels\ninto unified label groups. The Factorynet dataset, which includes noisy labels\nfrom both human annotations and web-scraped sources, is employed to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat the VLSR framework successfully identifies problematic labels and improves\nlabel consistency.

However, these classical ML models have\nlimitations, such as high computational demands, the need for large datasets,\nand long training times, which hinder their accessibility and efficiency. Our\nresearch uses MobileNET model for efficient detection of these tumors. The\nnovelty of this project lies in building an accurate tumor detection model\nwhich use less computing re-sources and runs in less time followed by efficient\ndecision making through the use of image processing technique for accurate\nresults. The suggested method attained an average accuracy of 98.5%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMobileNET\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u957f\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe98.5%\u3002", "motivation": "\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u5065\u5eb7\u6784\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u4e1a\u533b\u7597\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MobileNET\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523098.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Traditional frame-based cameras\nstruggle to detect small objects in complex environments due to their low frame\nrates, limited dynamic range, and data redundancy. Event cameras, with\nmicrosecond temporal resolution and high dynamic range, provide a more\neffective solution for SOD. However, existing event-based object detection\ndatasets are limited in scale, feature large targets size, and lack diverse\nbackgrounds, making them unsuitable for SOD benchmarks. In this paper, we\nintroduce a Event-based Small object detection (EVSOD) dataset (namely EV-UAV),\nthe first large-scale, highly diverse benchmark for anti-UAV tasks. It includes\n147 sequences with over 2.3 million event-level annotations, featuring\nextremely small targets (averaging 6.8 $\\times$ 5.4 pixels) and diverse\nscenarios such as urban clutter and extreme lighting conditions.

However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus\non single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing\nquestion: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our\nfindings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can\nprovide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are\nsubstantial differences in model size.

Work in progress", "summary": "Video identity customization seeks to synthesize realistic, temporally\ncoherent videos of a specific subject, given a single reference image and a\ntext prompt. This task presents two core challenges: (1) maintaining identity\nconsistency while aligning with the described appearance and actions, and (2)\ngenerating natural, fluid motion without unrealistic stiffness. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce Proteus-ID, a novel diffusion-based framework\nfor identity-consistent and motion-coherent video customization. First, we\npropose a Multimodal Identity Fusion (MIF) module that unifies visual and\ntextual cues into a joint identity representation using a Q-Former, providing\ncoherent guidance to the diffusion model and eliminating modality imbalance.\nSecond, we present a Time-Aware Identity Injection (TAII) mechanism that\ndynamically modulates identity conditioning across denoising steps, improving\nfine-detail reconstruction. Third, we propose Adaptive Motion Learning (AML), a\nself-supervised strategy that reweights the training loss based on\noptical-flow-derived motion heatmaps, enhancing motion realism without\nrequiring additional inputs.

To address these questions, we design\ntwo automated pipelines using stable diffusion to inpaint unusual objects with\nhigh diversity in semantics, by sampling multiple substantives from WordNet and\nChatGPT.

In this work,\nwe first identify a critical issue with existing conditional PT methods: using\nVII as the \"condition\" of prompts yields suboptimal performance, and even\nrandom noise-conditioned prompts can outperform the VII-conditioned\ncounterparts. On further analysis, we find that learning dynamic prompts\nconditioned on Textual Class Information (TCI) is the key to solving the BNT\nproblem. Motivated by this, we then propose Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning\n(CaPT), which enables fast adaptation of tuned models to new classes by\nlearning TCI-conditioned prompts from base classes. Remarkably, CaPT can be\nused as a plugin to mitigate the BNT problem for existing unconditional PT\nschemes. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets show that CaPT consistently\nimproves the performance of five strong unconditional PT baselines with\nnegligible additional computational cost. Additionally, by integrating CaPT\nwith our recently proposed DePT framework, we devise a new conditional PT\napproach, termed DeCaPT, which outperforms the H ACC of the state-of-the-art\nconditional PT scheme by 3.49%, averaged over the 11 datasets.

This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block\nAttention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for\nVDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within\npre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality,\nvarying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA\nenhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a\nlayer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to\ndiverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global\nblock selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions\nacross an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to\ndynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative\nsimilarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly\naccelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and\n1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation\nquality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance\nin training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for\nhigh-res video generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aVMoBA\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08VDMs\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u957f\u65f6\u957f\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "VMoBA\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u5757\u5206\u533a\u65b9\u6848\u3001\u5168\u5c40\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u7684\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u4e09\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "VMoBA\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VDMs\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff082.92x FLOPs\u548c1.48x\u5ef6\u8fdf\u52a0\u901f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff082.40x FLOPs\u548c1.35x\u5ef6\u8fdf\u52a0\u901f\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "VMoBA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

A presentation video of our approach is available at\n  https://youtu.be/_SGNhhNz0fE", "summary": "While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have enabled fast reconstruction\nof high-quality 3D scenes from images, extracting accurate surface meshes\nremains a challenge. Current approaches extract the surface through costly\npost-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or\nrequiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of\nvertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to\na surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all\ngeometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel\nGaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and\nsurface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D\nGaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the\nmesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration\ndirectly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities\noptimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical\ncontributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both\nrepresentations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying\ngeometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each\ntraining iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay\ntriangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D\nGaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric\nerosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds,\nwith state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh\nvertices than previous methods.

We develop a library to allow us to disentangle and review the\ncomponents of methods from the NeRV family, reframing their performance in\nterms of not only size-quality trade-offs, but also impacts on training time.\nWe uncover principles for effective video INR design and propose a\nstate-of-the-art configuration of these components, Rabbit NeRV (RNeRV). When\nall methods are given equal training time (equivalent to 300 NeRV epochs) for 7\ndifferent UVG videos at 1080p, RNeRV achieves +1.27% PSNR on average compared\nto the best-performing alternative for each video in our NeRV library. We then\ntackle the encoding speed issue head-on by investigating the viability of\nhyper-networks, which predict INR weights from video inputs, to disentangle\ntraining from encoding to allow for real-time encoding. We propose masking the\nweights of the predicted INR during training to allow for variable, higher\nquality compression, resulting in 1.7% improvements to both PSNR and MS-SSIM at\n0.037 bpp on the UCF-101 dataset, and we increase hyper-network parameters by\n0.4% for 2.5%/2.7% improvements to PSNR/MS-SSIM with equal bpp and similar\nspeeds.
