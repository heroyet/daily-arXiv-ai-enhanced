As technology scales down, EM-induced IR\ndrop becomes increasingly severe. While several EM-aware IR drop analysis tools\nhave been proposed, few incorporate the real impact of temperature distribution\non both EM and IR drop effects. In this work, we introduce EMSpice 2.1, an\nenhanced tool built upon the existing coupled IR-EM analysis framework, EMSpice\n2.0, for EM-aware IR drop analysis. For the first time, EMSpice 2.1 uniquely\nintegrates Joule heating effects and practical thermal maps derived from actual\nchip conditions. Additionally, it features improved interoperability with\ncommercial EDA tools, facilitating more comprehensive EM and IR drop sign-off\nanalysis. Our findings demonstrate that specific hotspot patterns significantly\nimpact the lifetime of interconnects and overall chip reliability due to EM\nfailures. Furthermore, our tool exhibits strong agreement with\nindustry-standard tools such as COMSOL, achieving a speedup of over 200 times\nwhile maintaining high accuracy."}

This is\nespecially problematic in dynamic traffic environments characterised by\nperiodic variations (e.g., day/night, peak hours), where past knowledge remains\nvaluable. Existing approaches like experience replay and visual prompts offer\nsome mitigation, but struggle to effectively prioritize and leverage historical\ndata for optimal knowledge retention and adaptation. Specifically, simply\nstoring and replaying all historical data can be inefficient, while treating\nall historical experiences as equally important overlooks their varying\nrelevance to the current domain. This paper proposes ER-EMU, an edge model\nupdate algorithm based on adaptive experience replay, to address these\nlimitations. ER-EMU utilizes a limited-size experience buffer managed using a\nFirst-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and a novel Domain Distance Metric-based\nExperience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm. DDM-ES employs the multi-kernel\nmaximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to quantify the dissimilarity between target\ndomains, prioritizing the selection of historical data that is most dissimilar\nto the current target domain. This ensures training diversity and facilitates\nthe retention of knowledge from a wider range of past experiences, while also\npreventing overfitting to the new domain. The experience buffer is also updated\nusing a simple random sampling strategy to maintain a balanced representation\nof previous domains.

While WSI has\nrevolutionized digital histopathology by enabling automated, precise analysis,\nit remains vulnerable to artifacts introduced during slide preparation and\nscanning. These artifacts can compromise downstream image analysis. To address\nthis challenge, we propose and compare three robust artifact detection\napproaches for WSIs: (1) a foundation model-based approach (FMA) using a\nfine-tuned Unified Neural Image (UNI) architecture, (2) a deep learning\napproach (DLA) built on a ResNet50 backbone, and (3) a knowledge-based approach\n(KBA) leveraging handcrafted features from texture, color, and frequency-based\nmetrics. The methods target six common artifact types: tissue folds,\nout-of-focus regions, air bubbles, tissue damage, marker traces, and blood\ncontamination. Evaluations were conducted on 50,000+ image patches from diverse\nscanners (Hamamatsu, Philips, Leica Aperio AT2) across multiple sites.

Recently, masked time-series modeling\nhas been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by\nreconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic\ninformation in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations\ngenerated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series\nignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious\ntemporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal\nsemantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled\npatterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a\nmasked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which\nincludes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that\nincorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a\nperiod masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked\nseasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking\nstrategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar\nvariations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task\nfor learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies.

However, the challenge of managing DS2D connectivity\nfor multi-constellations becomes outstanding, including high interference and\nfrequent handovers caused by multi-coverage overlap and rapid satellite\nmovement. Moreover, existing approaches primarily operate within\nsingle-constellation shell, which inherently limits the ability to exploit the\nvast potential of multi-constellation connectivity provision, resulting in\nsuboptimal DS2D service performances. To address these challenges, this article\nproposes a Constellation as a Service (CaaS) framework, which treats the entire\nmulti-constellation infrastructure as a shared resource pool and dynamically\nforms optimal sub-constellations (SCs) for each DS2D service region. The\nformation of each SC integrates satellites from various orbits to provide\ntailored connectivity based on user demands, guided by two innovative\nstrategies: predictive satellite beamforming using generative artificial\nintelligence (GenAI) and pre-configured handover path for efficient satellite\naccess and mobility management. Simulation results demonstrate that CaaS\nsignificantly improves satellite service rates while reducing handover\noverhead, making it an efficient and continuable solution for managing DS2D\nconnectivity in multi-constellation environments."}

Data pruning\noffers a solution by selecting smaller, informative subsets, yet existing\nmethods struggle: density-based approaches can be task-agnostic, while\nmodel-based techniques may introduce redundancy or prove computationally\nprohibitive. We introduce Adaptive De-Duplication (AdaDeDup), a novel hybrid\nframework that synergistically integrates density-based pruning with\nmodel-informed feedback in a cluster-adaptive manner.

There are several\nattempts to accomplish this task by the use of traditional 2D imaging, 3D\nreconstructions, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, they have\nseveral drawbacks when processing 3D data and identifying individual plant\ncomponents. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel Deep Learning\narchitecture to detect components of individual plants on Light Detection and\nRanging (LiDAR) 3D Point Cloud (PC) data sets. This architecture is based on\nthe concept of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and feature enhancing with\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA). For this, each point is taken as a vertex\nand by the use of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) layer, the edges are established,\nthus representing the 3D PC data set. Subsequently, Edge-Conv layers are used\nto further increase the features of each point. Finally, Graph Attention\nNetworks (GAT) are applied to classify visible phenotypic components of the\nplant, such as the leaf, stem, and soil.

In this scoping review,\nwe examined 26 empirical studies on interactions between people with dementia\nand physical social robots. We identify four key design cue categories that may\ninfluence deceptive impressions: cues resembling physiological signs (e.g.,\nsimulated breathing), social intentions (e.g., playful movement), familiar\nbeings (e.g., animal-like form and sound), and, to a lesser extent, cues that\nreveal artificiality.

These findings\nunderscore the fluctuating nature of ontological perception in dementia\ncontexts.

The core challenge lies in how to select the optimal\ninstances-rather than the entire datasets-to improve data quality and training\nefficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective data reduction strategy\nbased on Pointwise V-information(PVI). First, we quantify instance difficulty\nusing PVI and filter out low-difficulty instances enabling a static approach.\nExperiments demonstrate that removing 10%-30% of the data preserves the\nclassifier performance with only a 0.0001% to 0.76% loss in accuracy.Second, we\nuse a progressive learning approach to training the classifiers on instances\nsorted by ascending PVI, accelerating convergence and achieving a 0.8% accuracy\ngain over conventional training.

Our framework\nintroduces three key innovations: 1) an Enhanced Pyramid Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (EPGCN) with a novel decoder module for robust spatiotemporal feature\nupsampling. 2) Mixup-based training to synthesize out-of-distribution data,\neliminating reliance on manual annotations. 3) A novel Temporal Clustering loss\nthat groups in-distribution actions while distancing out-of-distribution\nsamples.\n  We evaluate our framework on two challenging human-object interaction\nrecognition datasets: Bimanual Actions and 2 Hands and Object (H2O) datasets.\nExperimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art\naction segmentation models across multiple open-set evaluation metrics,\nachieving 16.9% and 34.6% relative gains in open-set segmentation (F1@50) and\nout-of-distribution detection performances (AUROC), respectively. Additionally,\nwe conduct an in-depth ablation study to assess the impact of each proposed\ncomponent, identifying the optimal framework configuration for open-world\naction segmentation."}

Time series foundation models\nrepresent a significant extension of this paradigm, demonstrating exceptional\nexpressive power, generalization, and cross-domain transferability. However,\nthis gives rise to a fundamental paradox: time series data reflect distinct\ndynamical systems, making cross-domain transfer intuitively implausible, yet\nthis is contradicted by the models' empirical success. To resolve this paradox,\nthis paper investigates, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives,\nthe representation learning mechanisms and generalization capabilities of\npatch-based time series foundation models. We argue that such models are not\nmerely applying a new architecture but are fundamentally generalizing the\nrepresentation paradigm of language models by extending deterministic\nvector-based representations to latent probabilistic distributional forms. Our\ntheoretical analysis supports this framework by demonstrating that continuous\ntime-series patches can be faithfully quantized into a discrete vocabulary\nwhose key statistical properties are highly consistent with those of natural\nlanguage. This generalization allows time series models to inherit the robust\nrepresentation and transfer abilities of large language models, thereby\nexplaining their superior performance in temporal tasks.

Yet, how robotic design cues might\nelicit misleading perceptions in people with dementia, and how these\nperceptions arise, remains insufficiently understood. In this scoping review,\nwe examined 26 empirical studies on interactions between people with dementia\nand physical social robots. We identify four key design cue categories that may\ninfluence deceptive impressions: cues resembling physiological signs (e.g.,\nsimulated breathing), social intentions (e.g., playful movement), familiar\nbeings (e.g., animal-like form and sound), and, to a lesser extent, cues that\nreveal artificiality.

In the fine pose estimation stage, a\nparticle filtering method incorporating a multi-beam tracking approach is used\nto efficiently explore the hypothesis space and obtain the final pose\nestimation. To further facilitate research in this field, we release two\ndatasets with LoD1 city models covering 10.7 km , along with real RGB queries\nand ground-truth pose annotations. Experimental results show that LoD-Loc v2\nimproves estimation accuracy with high-LoD models and enables localization with\nlow-LoD models for the first time.

ER-EMU utilizes a limited-size experience buffer managed using a\nFirst-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and a novel Domain Distance Metric-based\nExperience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm. DDM-ES employs the multi-kernel\nmaximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to quantify the dissimilarity between target\ndomains, prioritizing the selection of historical data that is most dissimilar\nto the current target domain. This ensures training diversity and facilitates\nthe retention of knowledge from a wider range of past experiences, while also\npreventing overfitting to the new domain. The experience buffer is also updated\nusing a simple random sampling strategy to maintain a balanced representation\nof previous domains. Experiments on the Bellevue traffic video dataset,\ninvolving repeated day/night cycles, demonstrate that ER-EMU consistently\nimproves the performance of several state-of-the-art cloud-edge collaborative\nobject detection frameworks."}

Furthermore, they overlook the\nimpact on collision avoidance in motion planning, for example, 60.0 mAP leading\nto safer motion planning or 61.0 mAP leading to high-risk motion planning. In\nthis paper, we introduce latency-aware AP (L-AP) and planning-aware AP (P-AP)\nas new metrics, which consider the physical world such as the concept of time\nand physical constraints, offering a more comprehensive evaluation for\nreal-time 3D object detection.

Despite their success, optimization is notoriously challenging and they\nrequire regularization against overfitting. In this work, we explain the\nsuccess and limitations of GANs by interpreting them as probabilistic\ngenerative models. This interpretation enables us to view GANs as Bayesian\nneural networks with partial stochasticity, allowing us to establish conditions\nof universal approximation. We can then cast the adversarial-style optimization\nof several variants of GANs as the optimization of a proxy for the marginal\nlikelihood. Taking advantage of the connection between marginal likelihood\noptimization and Occam's razor, we can define regularization and optimization\nstrategies to smooth the loss landscape and search for solutions with minimum\ndescription length, which are associated with flat minima and good\ngeneralization. The results on a wide range of experiments indicate that these\nstrategies lead to performance improvements and pave the way to a deeper\nunderstanding of regularization strategies for GANs."}

Existing detection methods often struggle with\ngeneralization and capturing subtle temporal inconsistencies.

Inspired by the \"perceptual straightening\"\nhypothesis -- which suggests real-world video trajectories become more straight\nin neural representation domain -- we analyze deviations from this expected\ngeometric property. Using a pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer\n(DINOv2), we quantify the temporal curvature and stepwise distance in the\nmodel's representation domain. We aggregate statistics of these measures for\neach video and train a classifier.

While prior work has made strides using\ntextual descriptions, leveraging spoken language-known as Audio-based 3D Visual\nGrounding-remains underexplored and challenging. Motivated by advances in\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech representation learning, we\npropose Audio-3DVG, a simple yet effective framework that integrates audio and\nspatial information for enhanced grounding. Rather than treating speech as a\nmonolithic input, we decompose the task into two complementary components.\nFirst, we introduce Object Mention Detection, a multi-label classification task\nthat explicitly identifies which objects are referred to in the audio, enabling\nmore structured audio-scene reasoning. Second, we propose an Audio-Guided\nAttention module that captures interactions between candidate objects and\nrelational speech cues, improving target discrimination in cluttered scenes. To\nsupport benchmarking, we synthesize audio descriptions for standard 3DVG\ndatasets, including ScanRefer, Sr3D, and Nr3D.

While recent deep\nlearning models have shown promise in improving nowcasting skill, most\napproaches rely solely on 2D radar reflectivity fields, discarding valuable\nvertical information available in the full 3D radar volume. In this work, we\nexplore the use of Echo Top Height (ETH), a 2D projection indicating the\nmaximum altitude of radar reflectivity above a given threshold, as an auxiliary\ninput variable for deep learning-based nowcasting. We examine the relationship\nbetween ETH and radar reflectivity, confirming its relevance for predicting\nrainfall intensity. We implement a single-pass 3D U-Net that processes both the\nradar reflectivity and ETH as separate input channels.

We analyze the\nsensitivity of both non-robust and robust classifiers to noise of the diffusion\nprocess on the standard CelebA data set, the specialized SportBalls data set\nand the high-dimensional real-world CelebA-HQ data set.

A 6D pose tracker then extracts\nobject trajectories from the video, and the trajectories are retargeted to the\nrobot in an embodiment-agnostic fashion. Through extensive real-world\nevaluations, we show that filtered generated videos are as effective as real\ndemonstrations, and that performance improves with generation quality. We also\nshow that relying on generated videos outperforms more compact alternatives\nsuch as keypoint prediction using VLMs, and that strong 6D pose tracking\noutperforms other ways to extract trajectories, such as dense feature point\ntracking.
